Caption 
Atmospheric CO2 for the last 1000 years. WAIS Divide data (red, this study) are compared with those from the Law Dome (blue) [Etheridge et al., 1996; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006] and EPICA Dronning Maud Land (black) [Siegenthaler et al., 2005]. To facilitate comparison of CO2 records, a Gaussian filter (1Ïƒ = 10 years) was applied to interpolated annual data sets (darker lines).
